# The Texas Crutch

The Texas Crutch is a well-known barbecue technique that pitmasters use to improve resource usage during a long cook. In a time where 86% of restaurants are reporting a drop in profit margins over the last year, resource management is paramount[[1]](#references). But is wrapping a brisket the only way to increase return on investment as a restaurant owner? And is the real Texas Crutch actually the weather?

Whether or not Austin has a meteorological advantage, protecting a smoker from the elements is commonly thought of as helpful. Dry, still air is a good thermal insulator. But merely introducing convection changes the game, let alone precipitation. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and a higher heat transfer coefficient than air, making it an effective coolant.

It follows that chefs, trying to maintain as constant a temperature as possible over half a day, seek to remove these competing factors. But if a roof alone costs $10,000 does it ever pay for itself in fuel saved, reduced waste, or improved quality? Smoking a brisket will always be an art, but data-driven methods can tease out relationships that allow pitmasters to focus on their craft.

## Follow the Data
